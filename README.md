# AI Dashboard

This project is a **AI Dashboard** built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. This project is a responsive AI Dashboard built with React, Redux, and Recharts. It visualizes data related to AI interactions, including category distribution, user satisfaction, response times, and usage statistics. The dashboard is fully functional with dark and light mode support, and it handles loading and error states gracefully.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to both desktop and mobile views using a grid layout.
- **Dark and Light Modes**: The application supports both themes, switching based on user preferences.
- **Charts**: It features Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and Line Charts built with Recharts.
- **State Management**: Redux is used for managing application state, including AI data and theme preferences.
- **Error and Loading States**: Error messages and loading spinners are displayed during API calls.

## Installation & Setup

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running the following command in your project directory:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. After the installation is complete, start the development server using:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Key Technologies

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this project, React is used to build a dynamic, component-based architecture for managing celebrity profiles. It ensures smooth interactions and state management.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types. TypeScript is used in this project to improve the development process with type safety, better error detection, and improved autocompletion, enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.

- **Vite**: A modern build tool designed to optimize the development experience. Vite is used in this project for its lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and faster build times, allowing for an efficient and smooth development workflow.

- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library that simplifies handling the applicationâ€™s state. In this project, Redux Toolkit is used for managing data fetching, loading states, and error handling, enabling efficient state management across the app.

- **Recharts**: A charting library for rendering dynamic, interactive charts in React applications. Recharts is used to display various charts like bar charts, pie charts, and line charts in the dashboard for visualizing the celebrity data.

 **React Query**: A data-fetching and state management library that simplifies working with server data. React Query is used in this project to manage asynchronous data fetching, caching, and syncing, reducing boilerplate code for handling data fetching logic. It automatically handles background refetching, caching, and data synchronization for more efficient API requests.

- **SCSS (Sass)**: A powerful CSS preprocessor used to style the application. SCSS is used for managing the styles with variables, mixins, and reusable code blocks, making it easier to maintain and adjust the design for both light and dark themes.

- **React Icons**: A library that provides a set of customizable icons for React applications. In this project, React Icons is used to add visually appealing icons in the user interface, enhancing usability and user experience.
